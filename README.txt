Vermin!

All heads on deck, this is not a drill.
We have found a location with high military traffic. The uboats are practically sitting ducks. They should be easy pray.
Take down those pesky sub-par uboats. You should be able to manage to scavage enough ammunition from the wrecks to keep killing them.
Be weary, though, the traffic seem to move faster the more you kill. Anyway, it's of no concern to me.

Hail Hydra, and such.



I am working on implementing bosses, and possibly a little more challenge than a simple "duck hunt."
Anyhow, this version is an early, working, version. The first proper version imho.

We have a long way to go, but it's a start.
